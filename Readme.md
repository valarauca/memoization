Memoization

[Documentation](https://valarauca.github.io/memoization/memoization/index.html)

Is a relatively simple crate that allows for structure fields to be memoized in a fairly light weight way. It handles most the messy memory overloading so when treated a structure field it can be DefMut, Def, and Borrowed as it's native output data type.

TODO: Port project to core as dependence on std isn't necessary.
